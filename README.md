# Turing Machine
- depends on Python3.7
- clone this repo
- do `python3.7 path/to/this/script path/to/program input_string`
- expects:
  - to ignore line comments prefixed by `'//'`
  - transition definitions to be 5 characters separated by spaces
  - `'0'` as initial state (at least 1 transition from this state)
  - `'B'` as 'blank' tape symbol (don't use this for alphabet symbols)
  - `'f'` as final state (at least 1 transition to this state)

## Have fun!
